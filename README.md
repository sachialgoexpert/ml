This repository is dedicated to daily machine learning (ML) practice, focusing on building strong fundamentals, hands-on problem solving, and exam-oriented understanding.

The goal is to consistently practice ML concepts, implement algorithms from scratch when useful, and strengthen intuition through experiments and analysis.
